mySort is a user generated library that implements the insertion sort algorithm.

sortMain is the main program that test the mySort library, it works by generating six random numbers
and sorting them using mySort, if an error occurs after the sorting process the program will check that and throw an error,
as well as exit the program. If mySort sorts the array correctly the sorted array is printed and the program exits.
